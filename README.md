## Commands

See the [commands doc](./docs/commands.md) for usage and description of each command.

## Getting Started

### Running CLI from src

In the root of the repo, run `npm link` to create a symbolic link in your local npm configuration.
If you'd like to use projector in a separate directory, navigate to that directory and run `npm link projector`.

You will then be able to execute commands with the `pjr` executable inside that directory.

### Running Tests

In order to run tests (both unit and integration), set the environment variables specified in the `.env.sample` file.

The tests have already been configured to read variables from the `.env` file.

## Installation

Run `npm i` at root.

## Configuration

Configuration is located at `src/config`.

## Build

At root, run `npm run build`.

## Test

At root, run `npm run test`.

## Run

Run `pjr` to see the subcommands available.
